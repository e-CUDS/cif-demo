CIF tags considered in this case study
======================================

    _symmetry_Int_Tables_number
    Space-group number from International Tables for Crystallography
    Vol. A (2002).

    _cell_length_a
    _cell_length_b
    _cell_length_c
    _cell_angle_alpha
    _cell_angle_beta
    _cell_angle_gamma
    Unit cell parameters. Cell lengths are in Ångström and angles are
    in degree.

    _atom_site_label
    A unique identifier for a particular site in the crystal. Typically
    this will be the chemical symbol of the atom occupying this site,
    optionally followed by an number (e.g. "Cu1"), an underscore
    (e.g. "Zn_Zn_301_A_O") or an asterix (e.g. H*251). Other labels are
    possible, but not considered here.

    _atom_site_type_symbol (optional)
    A code to identify the atom species (singular or plural) occupying
    this site. Typically the chemical symbol of the atom species
    (e.g. "Ni").

    _atom_site_site_symmetry_multiplicity (optional)
    The number of different sites that are generated by the application of
    the space-group symmetry to the coordinates given for this site. It is
    equal to the multiplicity given for this Wyckoff site in International
    Tables for Crystallography Vol. A (2002).

    _atom_site_Wyckoff_symbol (optional)
    The Wyckoff symbol (letter) as listed in the space-group tables of
    International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A (2002).

    _atom_site_fract_x
    _atom_site_fract_y
    _atom_site_fract_z
    Atom-site coordinates as fractions of the _cell_length_ values.

    _atom_site_occupancy (optional)
    The fraction of the atom type present at this site. The sum of the
    occupancies of all the atom types at this site may not exceed 1.0.
